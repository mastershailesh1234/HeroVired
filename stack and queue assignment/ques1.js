// Q1. Student A took Student B's Laptop and started playing with him by changing his password. 
// B requested A to reveal the password, but A doesn't want to end the fun by revealing the password straightaway, 
// so he asked B to select a number N. Then he gave a set of N numbers, stating that if he takes the modulo of, a 
// sum of the given numbers with the smallest prime number from the given set of numbers if exists, else by finding 
// the smallest prime divisor of sum, would give him the age of his loved ones. So spinning the given numbers that 
// many times in an anticlockwise direction he will get the password for his device.

// Example:

// N = 6

// Input: 90 45 37 80 1 46

// Output: 80 1 46 90 45 37

// N = 5

// Input: 90 45 78 27 63

// Output: 27 63 90 45 78
